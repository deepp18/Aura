# 🌈 AURA: An Intelligent, Gamified System for Mood Tracking and Dream-Based Emotional Analysis

> “Mental wellness begins with understanding one’s own emotions.”

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Mental health has become a major concern in today’s fast-paced, digitally connected world — especially among younger generations.  
While existing wellness platforms and apps help track moods or offer therapy, they often **lack personalization, interactivity, and emotional engagement**, leading to low user retention and limited impact.

There is a need for an **AI-powered, gamified wellness platform** that helps users:
- Track their moods,
- Analyze dreams, and
- Receive personalized emotional insights  

— all while staying emotionally engaged through play and reflection.

**AURA** aims to fill this gap by combining **AI-driven emotion detection**, **dream interpretation**, and **interactive visualization** in a gamified, emotionally intelligent environment.

## 🌟 Description

**AURA** is an **AI-powered, gamified mental wellness platform** that helps users understand and regulate their emotions through:
- **Mood Tracking**
- **Dream Journaling**
- **AI Emotional Analysis**
- **Symbolic, Interactive Visualization**

The platform features a **Minecraft-style MoodWorld**, where the environment dynamically evolves based on the user’s emotional state — for example:
- Calm → serene environments 🌊  
- Anxiety → foggy skies 🌫️  
- Joy → blooming forests 🌸  

Users can log daily moods, record dreams, and receive emotional insights from a **custom-trained AI model** based on the **GoEmotions dataset (28 moods)**.

Unlike traditional mental health tools, AURA transforms emotional reflection into a **playful experience**.  
Users earn **MoodBlocks** and **LucidPoints** for consistent journaling, complete daily tasks, and can form **2-player mood parties** to face symbolic monsters (like *Anxietron* or *Procrastinodon*) in cooperative gameplay that represents overcoming internal struggles.

In addition, AURA offers:
- **AI-powered dream interpretation**
- **Emotion-based support villages** (e.g., *Sadland*, *JoyJump*)
- **Anonymous chat communities**
- **Mood-adaptive visual feedback**

Together, these features make **emotional awareness fun, personalized, and sustainable**.
